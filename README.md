# tokusentai
simple Discord chat bot lmao

based on [discord.js](https://discord.js.org)

i prefer using [standardjs](https://standardjs.com) when writing javascript. 

to set up your own developing environment do this:
  1. `git clone https://github.com/Markussss/tokusentai`
  2. create a copy of `.env_example` named and name it `.env`
  3. fill your `.env` file with the `CLIENT_ID` and the `TOKEN` of your bot
  4. run `npm install`
  5. start the bot by running `node tokusentai.js`
  
that's it, nothing fancy. maybe there will be fancy stuff later. it's a huge mess right now. maybe it'll get better, who knows.
